# Supervised-Learning-
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data. The algorithm learns the mapping between input features (X) and the corresponding target labels (Y) to make predictions. It uses this training data to generalize and predict the output for unseen data based on learned patterns.
