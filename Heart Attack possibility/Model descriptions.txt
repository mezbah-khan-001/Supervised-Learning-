                                                            # Healthcare Neural Network Model



## 📌 Project Overview  --> 
This project presents a deep learning model built using a neural network to analyze healthcare data. The model is designed for predictive analytics, assisting in disease prediction, patient risk assessment, and other healthcare-related insights. This repository provides the code, dataset details, and instructions to replicate and utilize the model.

## 📊 Dataset Information --> 
The dataset used in this project is derived from healthcare records, including patient demographics, clinical measurements, and diagnostic outcomes. It is structured as follows:
- **Features:** Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Level, Glucose Level, etc.
- **Target Variable:** Disease classification (e.g., Diabetes, Heart Disease)
- **Size:** (Mention dataset size, number of samples, and features)
- **Source:** (Specify the dataset source or whether it is synthetic)

## 🧠 Model Architecture --> 
The neural network comprises the following layers:
- **Input Layer:** Accepts multiple healthcare features
- **Hidden Layers:** Fully connected dense layers with activation functions (ReLU)
- **Dropout Layers:** Added to prevent overfitting
- **Output Layer:** Uses softmax/sigmoid activation for classification

**Technical Specifications:--> 
- **Frameworks Used:** TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch (mention the framework used)
- **Optimizer:** Adam/SGD
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy/Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## 🔧 Installation & Setup --> 
To set up the environment, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository --> 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/healthcare-nn.git

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage Instructions--> 
### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and ready for training.

```python
from data_processing import load_data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_data("dataset.csv")
```

### 2️⃣ Training the Model
Run the following script to train the model:

```python
python train.py
```

### 3️⃣ Evaluating the Model
After training, evaluate the performance using:

```python
python evaluate.py
```
