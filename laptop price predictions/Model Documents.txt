Laptop Price Prediction Model

Introduction

The Laptop Price Prediction Model is a machine learning-based system designed to estimate the price of a laptop based on its specifications. This model leverages supervised learning techniques, primarily regression algorithms, to predict laptop prices with high accuracy.

Objective

The main objective of this model is to provide a reliable price estimation based on key laptop specifications such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, GPU, operating system, display size, and weight. It can be used by retailers, e-commerce platforms, and customers to understand the price trends and make informed purchase decisions.

Dataset

Source of Data

The dataset used for this project consists of laptop specifications and their corresponding market prices collected from various e-commerce websites and retailer databases.

Features (Independent Variables)

Company (Brand): Categorical (e.g., Dell, HP, Apple, Lenovo, Asus, Acer, etc.)

Type of Laptop: Categorical (e.g., Ultrabook, Gaming, Notebook, Convertible, etc.)

Screen Resolution: Categorical (e.g., 1366x768, 1920x1080, 3840x2160, etc.)

Processor (CPU): Categorical (e.g., Intel i3/i5/i7/i9, AMD Ryzen 5/7/9, Apple M1, etc.)

RAM Size: Numerical (e.g., 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, etc.)

Storage (SSD + HDD): Numerical (e.g., 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD, etc.)

GPU: Categorical (e.g., Nvidia GTX 1650, RTX 3060, AMD Radeon RX 5500M, etc.)

Operating System: Categorical (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux, DOS, etc.)

Weight: Numerical (e.g., 1.2 kg, 2.5 kg, etc.)

Screen Size (Inches): Numerical (e.g., 13.3, 14, 15.6, 17.3, etc.)

Target Variable (Dependent Variable)

Price: Continuous variable (e.g., $500, $1200, $2500, etc.)

Data Preprocessing

To ensure high model performance, the dataset undergoes the following preprocessing steps:

Handling Missing Values: Filling or removing null values using imputation techniques.

Encoding Categorical Variables:

Label Encoding for ordinal data (e.g., CPU ranking).

One-Hot Encoding for nominal data (e.g., Brand, OS, GPU, etc.).

Feature Scaling:

Standardization (Z-score normalization) for numerical features like RAM, Weight, and Storage.

Min-Max Scaling for screen size and resolution.

Outlier Detection and Removal:

Using the IQR method to remove price outliers.

Boxplots and scatter plots to visualize data distribution.

Model Selection

Various machine learning models are tested, including:

Linear Regression: A simple baseline model.

Polynomial Regression: To capture non-linear relationships.

Random Forest Regression: A powerful ensemble method for handling categorical and numerical data.

Gradient Boosting Models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost): To improve accuracy through boosting techniques.

Neural Network Regression: Using Deep Learning (ANNs) to capture complex relationships.

Model Training and Evaluation

Training Process

The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing.

Feature selection is performed to remove redundant columns.

Hyperparameter tuning is applied using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

Evaluation Metrics

To assess model performance, the following metrics are used:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Penalizes large errors more than small ones.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, providing a more interpretable metric.

R² Score (Coefficient of Determination): Indicates how well the model explains variance in the target variable.
